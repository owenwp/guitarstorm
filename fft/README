This directory contains the packages realfft(3) and fft(3) that do Cooley-Tukey
fast Fourier transform on an arbitrary number of real or complex samples,
respectively.

The package was tested on 4.[12] bsd & Sun Release 3.5, but it should work on
any UNIX system featuring sin(3M) and malloc(3).

Contents:
	complex.h	- include file (for users of fft(3) routines).
	fft		- manual and source of fft(3).
	realfft		- manual and source of realfft(3).
	example		- example of how to use realfft(3).

See the README's in fft/, realfft/ and example/ to find out how to compile and
use things.
